Calvin Klein Obsession EDT For Men 125ml
Calvin Klein Obsession EDT For Men 125ml
One of the world's leading lifestyle brands, Calvin Klein is synonymous with authentic modern minimalist style. Everything it creates -clothing, accessories, home design-becomes a timeless classic. The label's award-winning fragrances are no exception. Calvin Klein's portfolio of bold and iconic scents continues to redefine the world of perfume. "Men have always been driven by their passions." Obsession for Men by Calvin Klein was inspired by that determination and fire. A potent, powerful and intensely provocative fragrance, it is an essentially masculine blend of balsamics, spices and rare woods. As compelling today as at its launch, Obsession for Men starts with a fresh bergamot-mandarin accord that proceeds to a spicy heart accented with lavender and sage. Musk and sandalwood contribute to a long lasting, ambery finish. Created by Calvin Klein, the fragrance reflects the designer's own obsessions. Often referred to as "the 80s in a bottle" because it so perfectly captured the glamour and sexuality of the decade's excessive lifestyle, Obsession for Men earned a notorious reputation for its unforgettably provocative, groundbreaking advertising.
