The joining of sweet and citrus flavors concoct a scrumptious aroma reminiscent of a fruit cocktail. At the heart of the perfume, breath in the orange blossoms, jasmine, and heliotrope. The heliotrope plant contributes deliciously scented purple and blue flowers to the unique formula. The foundation of this perfume incorporates sandalwood, vanilla, and tonka bean. Sandalwood is a heavy, yellow wood that maintains its earth fragrance for decades. Tonka bean has a fragrance that is similar to vanilla.
