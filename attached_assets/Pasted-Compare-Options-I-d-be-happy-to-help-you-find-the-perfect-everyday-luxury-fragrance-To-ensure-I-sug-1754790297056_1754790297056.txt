Diesel Only The Brave EDT
Diesel Only The Brave EDT
Only The Brave Cologne by Diesel, Launched in 2009, Only the Brave makes clear what it's all about, starting from the fist-shaped glass flacon. A heavily balsamic and animalic accord built around leather, this cologne leaves a profoundly masculine impression from the start, with notes of leather apparent from the first application. This opening is joined by sparkling lemon and mandarin orange to deliver a fresh burst of energy to the senses. The earthy heart uses cedar, violet and coriander to contrast the citrus opening and lead into the long-lasting drydown. Warm, rich amber and labdanum combine with the ever-present leather notes and resinous benzoin and styrax to surround the wearer for hours.
